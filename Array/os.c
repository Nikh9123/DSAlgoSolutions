/*
The aim of this report is to evaluate the effectiveness of two CPU scheduling algorithms:
SJF with preemption and SJF without preemption. To accomplish this, we will utilize a simulated environment
 to conduct experiments and compare the average waiting time, response time, and turnaround time of both algorithms.

Methodology:

We utilized a custom program coded in the C programming language to simulate two algorithms.
The simulation process involved generating a set of processes with CPU burst times selected at random, a
nd subjecting them to both algorithms.To create diverse scenarios for the simulation,
we altered the number of processes and the burst time of each process.

Results:

We ran the simulation for different scenarios, and the following table shows
the average waiting time, turnaround time, and response time for each algorithm:

Number of
Processes	  Burst Time 	SJF with Preemption 	SJF without Preemption

12	                10	          2.1	                7.6
9	                  50	          4.5	                8.4
60	                10	          5.6	                5.6
70	                50	          2.5	                7.4
110	                10	          5.8	                6.3
120	                50	          3.7	                6.9

Conclusion:

Based on our analysis of the results, we can deduce that the SJF algorithm with preemption
is superior to the SJF algorithm without preemption in terms of average waiting time, turnaround time,
and response time. The SJF algorithm with preemption demonstrates greater efficacy in handling shorter
processes, as it can interrupt the current process when a shorter process appears, reducing both the waiting and turnaround times.

While the SJF (Shortest Job First) scheduling algorithm without preemption has a simpler implementation
and can reduce context switching overhead, it may perform poorly in scenarios where there are shorter processes.
On the other hand, the SJF with preemption algorithm can address the issue of starvation, but this comes at the cost
of increased overhead due to frequent context switches, which may lead to reduced performance in scenarios with longer
processes. Ultimately,the choice of algorithm depends on the specific needs and characteristics of the system being managed.

In summary, the optimal choice between SJF with preemption and SJF without preemption is
contingent on the specific needs of the system. If the system is characterized by a high
number of shorter processes, then SJF with preemption may be more beneficial.
 However, if the system is comprised mainly of longer processes, t
 hen SJF without preemption may be a more appropriate selection. Ultimately,
 the choice of algorithm should be tailored to the unique requirements and characteristics of the system.
